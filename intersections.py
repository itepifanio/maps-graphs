## first, we loop through the ways of a particular area (ways1); saving their `id` and the `nodes` they hold
## then, we loop through these held `nodes` and for each of them we query their the ways they are part of; we filter this ways so that we only get actual ones (ways2)
## finally, we loop through each of these ways2 and search for the ones which differ from the initial way -- up in the initial loop -- because this would mean that the `node` in the second loop is part of more than 1 actual `way`
